        While reading Paul Lansky's lecture "<a href="https://paul.mycpanel.princeton.edu/lansky_beingdigital.pdf" style="color: black">The Importance of Being Digital</a>," I was amazed by an example presented of an audio plugin named "Shapee" that could map the timbral qualities of one source audio onto the frequency components of another. Lansky demonstrated how the pitches of Brahms's lullaby, performed by an orchestra, could be shaped by the timbral components of a choir singing Perotin. The transformation resulted in a convincing approximation of Brahms's lullaby sung by a choir.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though I could not find the actual Shapee application online, I did find Christopher Penrose's paper "<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d272/a11b7e86da4cb5dae278b6d0a2cd42ab5115.pdf" style="color:black">Frequency Shaping of Audio Signals</a>," which proposes the method that Shapee is based on. From this paper, I implemented my own Shapee application in Go. The transformation is much like a vocoder, using the STFT of the two audio files as well as a user-defined number of DFT filters to compute a mixture of the signals.

    <!-- ============= Super Resolution Audio Stretch ============= -->
    <h2>Super Resolution Audio Stretch (SRAS)</h2>
    <img src="images/spectogram.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <p>
        The ability to time stretch audio while maintaining pitch is an important tool for sound designers, musicians, and for any situation where the timing of sound elements must be synchronized to some arbitrary guideline. The most popular algorithms used today are hand-designed to interpolate the missing pieces of the lengthened audio. The results can sometimes sound metallic or unnatural, especially when the audio is stretched substantially.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am investigating whether a convolutional neural network could be of use in this audio manipulation problem. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00853" style="color:black;">Audio super resolution</a> is a related task in which a higher sample rate is achieved through deep-learned manipulation of the low-resolution signal. I intend to apply the methods of audio super resolution to the task of time stretching primarily to produce higher quality time stretching, but also as a general audio experiment that may result in interesting transformations.
